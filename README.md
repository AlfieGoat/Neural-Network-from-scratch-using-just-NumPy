# Neural Network from scratch using just NumPy
This was my first proper implementation of a Neural Network. 
It is very simple, but you can create a neural network model with however many layers you want with as many neurons as you want,
you can choose batch size, number of epochs, save/load the model and choose some activation functions.

This is very rudimentarily put together as I have other things I would like to work on, so is not perfect, but it does work well.

Thank you for reading :)
